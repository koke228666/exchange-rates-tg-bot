This bot recognizes numbers and currencies in the text and then automatically sends a message in which the amount is converted to other currencies.

Try writing: "5 euros" or "two hundred and forty four dollars".

If you want to know about the authors, version, source code, and/or license, use the /about command.

If you want to change the output currencies or the rights to delete messages, use the /settings command.

If you notice a recognition error, other malfunctions, or have a suggestion for improvement, please write to us in the feedback bot: @ertb_support_bot
